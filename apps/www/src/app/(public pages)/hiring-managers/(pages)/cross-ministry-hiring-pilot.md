Our team of CITZ and PSA staff help with recruiting, publishing the job post, and answering questions as they come in to make sure we attract as many qualified candidates as possible.

{% icon-list-item icon="4" iconColor="text-white" iconBgColor="bg-bcgov-blue-dark" text="Evaluate and interview candidates" %}

Hires go through the same meritorious process as other BC gov candidates: screening, assessment, interviews, and reference checks. We have tailored the information we ask to reduce friction for applying, while still giving the hiring team enough information to make the decision efficiently.

## Hiring manager time commitments {% #hiring-manager-time-commitments %}

We have 2 involvement options for hiring managers:

- [Minimal Involvement](#hm-time-commitment-minimal-involvement)
- [Full Involvement](#hm-time-commitment-full-involvement)

We will try to honor your preference, but involvement ultimately depends on the number of candidates and hiring managers we have. For instance, more hiring managers might want to be fully involved than we have panel interviews for

#### Minimal involvement {% #hm-time-commitment-minimal-involvement %}

Allows you to have input on the initial posting and indicate your preferences on successful candidates, but you're not involved in assessing candidates.
