# Cross-Ministry Hiring Program: Facts for hiring managers 

Our team has classification workers from the PSA, who streamline the process of getting position numbers.  

When we reach the stage of approving job profiles as a group, it’s important to be mindful of having too many preferred skills. Numerous preferences could reduce the chances of a larger and diverse candidate pool.  

**Please note**: once the posting is live, hiring managers cannot excuse themselves from the competition. We do not want the candidate pool negatively impacted. But, if the situation calls for hiring cancellation, then our team needs a written reason. We give it to the Merit Commissioner’s office and notify all candidates of the change.  

Our services are **cost-free**. 

## Eligibility Lists

When possible, our teams creates eligibility lists with each round of the Cross-Ministry Hiring Program (CMHP).  

The program can hire for many vacancies of the same classification and job title. We combine a candidate matching process with the eligibility lists. We match positions to candidates based on work locations, skillsets preference and vacancy appeal.  

Offers match candidate preference as close as possible. Sometimes, more vacancies exist than candidates, and more candidates are available than vacancies. The first offer goes to the top candidate, then second to the first candidate on the e-list, and so on.

Only partaking ministries in a hiring cycle can use the list to fill future vacancies. These vacancies must be of the same classifications and job title. Cross-Ministry Hiring Program eligibility lists can vary in timeframe, from 3 months to 1 year. Often, the lists deplete before they expire.

## Creating a hiring panel

Hiring managers who choose **Full Involvement** have a chance to be panel members. Depending on demand, we will use a lotto system to choose to select which hiring managers will be on the panel. Using the lotto system creates an equal opportunity and diversity. 

## 5-day review period

The positions included in the union have a mandatory 5-day review period. This only applies to candidates internal to B.C. government. 

After we send the conditional offer and regret letters, internal candidates have 5 business days to ask us for feedback. If an internal candidate does, they have another 5 business days to request a review from the Deputy Minister (DM).  

The period ends on a business day, not on a weekend or statutory holiday. We check with the Deputy Minister’s office for any requests for review. 

 If there are requests  the Deputy Minister’s office conducts the review. If further action is needed, the request can be escalated to the Office of the Merit Commissioner.   

In the case of escalation, we act as a liaison between the Merit Commissioner and ministries.   

## Restrictions

 

- The Cross-Ministry Hiring Program only hires for permanent, full-time positions.  

- Hiring managers cannot do suitability interviews. 

    - Section 3 in the Public Service Act states any appointments to the BC Public Service must be based on the principles of merit and assessment.  

    - Candidates undergo rigorous stages, so we know they meet the skills, knowledge, and experience consistent with the job profile.
      
    - Suitability interviews don’t match this requirement because they are based on different principles.
