Social equity creates an inclusive society. One where everyone has the same chances and a high standard of life. To create this society, we meet marginalized communities where they are. Then we have initiatives to bring them to same place where the social dominant groups are.
BC Gov supports 5 primary social equity initiatives: 
- Reconciliation
- Anti-Racism 
- Accessibility
- Gender Equity 
- Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the BC Public Service

The [Where we all belong: Diversity & Inclusion Strategy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/careers/about-the-bc-public-service/diversity-inclusion-respect/di_roadmap.pdf) outlines a 3 year strategy to have a public service that reflects our province.    
Over 36, 000 employees work in our organization and our diversity informs our work. We start and finish tasks with a social equity lens. We call this process intersectional analysis, a term that comes from Intersectionality.

Intersectionality means considering different demographic characteristics together instead of separately. Kimberlé Crenshaw used the term in [“Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex”](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=uclf). She argued Black women experienced legal inequity on race and gender discrimination. 

This happened because the courts decided on each characteristic separately. But Black women can experience both race and gender discrimination at the same time. Getting justice becomes hard if they are seen only as Black, or only as women. 

Now, intersectionality includes more characteristics. 

Our process of intersectional analysis starts with socially locating ourselves. Social location means a person’s combination of demographic characteristics, like race, gender, ability, and age. Everyone’s combination will likely be different. Once we become aware of our social location, we understand how we interact with systems of power and marginalization. 

Social locating helps us to know where unconscious bias plays a role, and where and how we can stop the bias. By doing this analysis, we ensure our services benefit all B.C. residents.

One of the common tools to social locate is Sylvia Duckworth’s Wheel of Power/Privilege. The version below comes from Canadian Institutes of Health Research’s  [“Meet the Methods series: Quantitative intersectional study design and primary data collection”](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/52352.html)

## Reconciliation

Reconciliation means settlers confronting the past and current harms against Indigenous Peoples. Then, building a future based on Indigenous rights, respect, and partnership. This looks like re-writing law, policies and processes to remove systemic racism. 

The [Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/19044) (Declaration Act) gives BC Govt guidance. The Act sets the framework for Reconciliation between BC Govt and Indigenous Peoples. 

The [Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/indigenous-relations-reconciliation) (MIRR) leads provincial actions on behalf of BC Gov. Some of the featured topics MIRR has are: 

-	[Economic Development](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/indigenous-people/economic-development)
-	[Consulting First Nations](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations)
-	[Minister's Advisory Council on Indigenous Women](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/indigenous-people/minister-s-advisory-council-on-indigenous-women-maciw) (MACIW) 

Truth and Reconciliation is important because it creates a future without systemic racism. Truth always comes first.

Before Canada became a nation, Indigenous communities were stewards of land and water. As stewards, they had (and continue to have) a strong relationship with nature.

When settlers came to Turtle Island, they took northern Indigenous lands. Settlers renamed them Canada. This outcome was possible because settlers strategized to control Indigenous Peoples. Some forms of control were land reservations, residential schools, and the Indian Act.
All ways strived to remove Indigenous cultures and knowledge. The violence lasted centuries. The stewards were harmed, and so was their ability to keep a healthy ecosystem. Without them, settlers abused natural resources for profit. 

This is colonization. Indigenous Peoples always resisted colonization. 

In 2019, the [National Centre of Truth and Reconciliation](https://nctr.ca/) issued the [231 Calls to Action](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/indigenous-people/aboriginal-peoples-documents/calls_to_action_english2.pdf). The Calls to Action offer comprehensive solutions for past harms and most are government focused. The report became the core of Reconciliation. BC Govt responds to the Calls to Action, guided by the Declaration Act. 

Colonization is complex. Intersectional analysis transforms a colonial mindset. One way to change is using Indigenous Gender Based Analysis Plus (IGBA+) Toolkit created by MACIW. It offers us the 7 IGBA+ Toolkit Guiding Principles:

![7 IGBA+ Toolkit Guiding Principles](7%20IGBA%20Toolkit%20Guiding%20Principles.png)

Though the MACIW offered settlers the Guiding Principles, only Indigenous Peoples can use IGBA+ authentically. This happens because IGBA+ needs Indigeneity for full understanding.

All toolkits based on social equity are effective after socially locating. Doing so takes BC Gov one step closer to decolonization. 

## Accessibility Directorate 

Within the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction is the [Accessibility Directorate](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility). The directorate works to dismantle systemic barriers that People with Disabilities go through daily.

After BC Gov passed the Accessible British Columbia Act, the directorate released [B.C.’s Accessibility Plan for 2023/23 to 2024/25](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility/legislation/accessiblebc). It is often referred to as AccessibleBC. The plan outlines 5 priorities: 

- Creating a culture of accessibility and inclusion
- Information and communications
- Buildings, infrastructure and public spaces
- Employment in the B.C. Public Service
- Delivery of goods and services 

Each priority has actions showing the way forward. When drafting the plan and the Act, the directorate included principles from the [United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/declaration-rights-disabled-persons).

The plan declares area leads from across BC Gov for each action. The directorate then publishes a report of outcomes. This holds each ministry accountable to sustainable change. 

To know more about service barriers, the directorate launched a [public feedback mechanism](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility/feedback). The form collects feedback of affected People with Disabilities and/or observers. There are other ways to submit the form if online is not possible.

There are many ways to understand what an accessible society looks like. Some helpful resources are: 

- [National AccessAbility Week](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/campaigns/national-accessability-week.html)
- [W3 Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
- [Global Accessibility Awareness Day](https://accessibility.day/)

## Anti-Racism

The Ministry of Attorney General and the Ministry of Citizens’ Services collaborate on anti-racism. The [Multiculturalism and Anti-Racism branch](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/multiculturalism-anti-racism)) and [BC Stats](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/about-data-management/bc-stats) branch work together on the Anti-Racism law. They also create ways to confront systemic racism after consultation with affected communities.

In 2020, Premier Horgan wrote to BC’s Office of the Human Rights Commissioner and Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner. The topic was anti-racism and disaggregated demographic data collection. 
The Commissioners’ offices collaborated and wrote [the grandmother’s perspective report](https://bchumanrights.ca/publications/datacollection/). This means:

>“First Nations governments are not wanting to operate with the Big Brother mentality that we’ve all been groomed into believing in relation to what data does to us – it’s more like we want to come from the grandmother perspective. We need to know because we care.”

[Gwen Phillips](https://fnigc.ca/about-fnigc/our-board-of-directors/gwen-phillips/) offers us this approach. She is from the Ktunaxa Nation, and a BC First Nations data governance champion.

The report shows a path forward to an anti-racist society. Then, BC Gov co-developed its first anti-racism law with Indigenous Peoples: [the Anti-Racism Data Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/22018). 

We continue to grow our capacity to confront different forms of systemic racism. BC Gov's [Anti-racism website](https://antiracism.gov.bc.ca/) offers more information about the current initiatives. In September 2022, BC Gov appointed 11 people to the anti-racism data committee. Their purpose:

>“Committee members represent the diversity of B.C. and will provide input about how demographic data will be collected and used safely in order to illuminate gaps in government services and dismantle systemic barriers to government programs. The committee will recommend priorities for research, and review statistics prior to their release to prevent future community harms.”

To help the committee, BC Stats recently launched the [BC Demographic Survey](https://bcstats.apps.gov.bc.ca/i/cwx.cgi?_lang=en&_crypt=0648090e3706647073453404412d467e0c0c1a2a1730). The data from the survey offers the committee a broader picture of where barriers are and how to dismantle them.


## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion 

Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion
The BC Public Service strives to create a public sector that is reflective of our province. This means being inclusive of Indigenous Peoples, minorities communities, newcomers, People with Disabilities and 2SLGBTQIA+ communities. 

The Public Service Agency (PSA) creates the plan and supports government leaders to action. We call the plan the Diversity & Inclusion Strategy. It shows our mandate, vision, values, diversity and inclusion goals, areas of focus and outcomes.

The plan shows the way to build a fair workplace. This looks like everyone getting development opportunities with corporate services and products. An outcome of the plan is the Equity Internship program. It is a 12-month program for BIPOC and/or 2SLGBTQIA+ peoples to get government experience in many ways.

There are many volunteer-run employee resource groups (ERG) in our organization. Marginalized and underrepresented staff can connect with others with similar lived experience: 

### Indigenous Employees Network 

The Indigenous Employees Network offers a community for Indigenous employees and meets monthly.

- [Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/indigenous-relations-reconciliation)'s featured topics

### BIPOC Employee Resource Group

BIPOC stands for Black (B), Indigenous (I), and People of Colour (POC). 

These communities experience different forms of racism. The BIPOC ERG has chances for racialized staff to connect and work together on Anti-racism initiatives.

- [Anti-Racism in BC](https://antiracism.gov.bc.ca/?utm_campaign=45097_CITZ_IP_BCDS__LEARN_ADW_BCGOV_EN_BC__TEXT)

### 2SLGBTQIA+ Employee Resource Group 

2SLGBTQIA+ stands for 2-Spirited, Lesbian (L), Gay (G), Bisexual (B), Transgender (T), Queer (Q), Intersex (I), and Asexual (A). The plus (+) stands for sexual and gender identities not represented.
The 2SLGBTQIA+ represents gender, sexual, and relationship diverse (GSRD) communities. 

BC Gov affirms living on Indigenous lands. This is why 2-Spirited (2S) is at the front of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community acronym.
