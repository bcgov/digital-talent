Social equity creates an inclusive society. One where everyone has the same chances and a high standard of life. To create this society, we meet marginalized communities where they are. Then we have initiatives to bring them to same place where the social dominant groups are.
BC Gov supports 5 primary social equity initiatives: 
- Reconciliation
- Anti-Racism 
- Accessibility Directorate
- Gender Equity 
- Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the BC Public Service

The Where we all belong: Diversity & Inclusion Strategy outlines a 3 year strategy to have a public service that reflects our province.    
Over 36, 000 employees work in our organization and our diversity informs our work. We start and finish tasks with a social equity lens. We call this process intersectional analysis, a term that comes from Intersectionality.

Intersectionality means considering different demographic characteristics together instead of separately. Kimberlé Crenshaw used the term in “Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex”. She argued Black women experienced legal inequity on race and gender discrimination. 

This happened because the courts decided on each characteristic separately. But Black women can experience both race and gender discrimination at the same time. Getting justice becomes hard if they are seen only as Black, or only as women. 

Now, intersectionality includes more characteristics. 

Our process of intersectional analysis starts with socially locating ourselves. Social location means a person’s combination of demographic characteristics, like race, gender, ability, and age. Everyone’s combination will likely be different. Once we become aware of our social location, we understand how we interact with systems of power and marginalization. 

Social locating helps us to know where unconscious bias plays a role, and where and how we can stop the bias. By doing this analysis, we ensure our services benefit all B.C. residents. 

One of the common tools to social locate is Sylvia Duckworth’s Wheel of Power/Privilege. The version below comes from Canadian Institutes of Health Research’s  “Meet the Methods series: Quantitative intersectional study design and primary data collection”:
