## Multi-region job opportunities 

 

All BC Gov staff can and do work in different regions within British Columbia.  If a candidate does not live in the province but intends to move, they can still apply. Although, a candidate must live in BC when they accept a job offer. [a sentence and a link to policy?] 

Sometimes, workers must attend trainings, meetings, or other events. For this reason, staff usually work in areas that have physical offices. 

Please note if a job posting says, “may be completed from any location inside BC”, not all locations come up. Because the province is large, we cannot list every town and city. 

 

### Working from home options 

 

BC Gov has telework agreements that allowwork from home. Telework policies depends on the ministry, the branch, and the position needs. The current options are remote, hybrid, and on-site.  

Telework agreements are independent of geographical location of a position. 

 

## Applying for a BC Gov job 


**Step 1**

Postings are open for at least 2 weeks and the job posting always has a close date. We accept applications until 11:59 p.m. PST on that date.  

In the application process, candidates must show they meet the following criteria: 

Minimum education in the job profile 

Minimum experience in the job profile 

Preferences are different from required criteria. Hiring managers use preferences to highlight the skills they are looking for. Candidates give a resume and complete a questionnaire to show they meet the criteria. 

We have questionnaires so candidates have a fair chance to show how they meet the job’s criteria. Hiring managers tend to choose questionnaires instead of cover letters. Candidates should always look at the question structure because answers must be specific.  

For example: 

Some tips:  

Remember to save often. 

Candidates cannot edit responses after submitting the application. 

We do not accept “see resume” responses. 

After candidates submit their resume and questionnaire, we begin shortlisting. We use the education and experience criteria in the job posting and profile. Candidates must show how they meet these criteria in their application. 

**Step 2** 

Shortlisted candidates complete an assessment that tests their skills. For technical jobs, like Full Stack Developer, we partner with a third party for skills testing. For non-technical roles, assessments are different.  Internal subject matter experts design non-technical assessments. Our team uses them to assess candidates for the required skills for the job.  

Candidates with passing scores move onto the interview phase.  

**Step 3** 

After the assessment, we interview shortlisted candidates. These interviews take place on Microsoft Teams. We send candidates interview instructions, and questions 24 hours before their scheduled interview. 

Interviews with BC Gov may assess knowledge, skills, abilities, and/or behavioural competencies. Job competencies are on the job profile. We use competencies so candidates can give examples of prior behaviours that relate to the job. Questions may include organizational alignment, and role-play of workplace situations.  

Only shortlisted candidates have their references and security clearance checked.  

 

### Security clearance 
 

Security screening checks the history and background of successful candidates. Because of the nature of many positions, screening includes a criminal record check (CRC). A CRC searches for convictions, penalties, or outstanding charges. 

The purpose of clearance is:  

-  Protect safety and security of vulnerable people in care of public service staff. 

-  Protect financial and information assets of the Province.  

-  Keep the integrity of provincial law enforcement. 

-  Keep public trust and confidence in public service staff.  

Even if candidates have a criminal record, they may be eligible for employment. We manage these situations case-by-case. Please contact us at digital.talent@gov.bc.ca for more information. 

A BC Gov criminal record check (CRC) is mandatory for all designated positions. 

**Step 4** 

Job offers have two stages:  

-  Verbal 

-  Conditional Offer  

-  Confirmation Letter 

Hiring managers offer the top candidate the position. The candidate can ask questions during this time. Conditional offers are conditional because of the security clearance and potential requests for review[link to 5 day review] We send confirmation letters after the clearance finishes.  

While there may be 1 position available, more vacancies could come up. For this reason, BC gov may use eligibility lists. 

 

### Eligibility Lists (e-lists) 

 

Our organization changes as public needs change. More vacancies can become available. E-lists are active between 3 – 18 months. 

In many competitions, there is 1 job available. The job offer goes to the top candidate. To case of vacancies, hiring managers shortlist more candidates. They then rank and place them on an eligibility list. E-list candidates receive a letter that confirms the duration. 

When a vacancy with the same job title and classification comes up, candidates can get an offer. Sometimes vacancies can be in different ministries or branches. Depending on the candidate’s availability, they can start immediately.  

The main benefits of e-lists are saving time and effort. Candidates do not need to complete the same application process many times. Hiring managers do not need to run another competition. 

Please note: we remove candidates from e-lists if they refuse an offer twice. 

2 ways we use e-lists 

 

There are 2 primary ways we use e-lists, depending on the hiring program:  

-  Cross-Ministry Hiring Program (CMHP) 

-  Regular hiring 

 

The CMHP can have many vacancies with the same title and classification it hires for. Each candidate tells us their region preference and ranks vacancies by appeal. We match candidates with jobs as much as possible. The first offer goes to the top candidate, then second to the first candidate on the e-list, and so on.  

Regular hiring e-lists are traditional. Hiring managers offer the job to the top candidate, then the e-list goes to other hiring managers. If there are no immediate vacancies, then a candidate may receive a job before the end of the e-list’s duration.  

 

**Step 5** 

BC gov has a unionized environment, and there are ‘included’ in union positions, and ‘excluded’ from union positions. We may hire for both. Our hiring process for ‘included’ positions includes a 5-day review period. This only applies to candidates internal to BC Gov applying for unionized positions.  

The review period starts when candidates get an offer letter or regret letters. If an internal candidate wants feedback, they can ask within the 5 days. The same candidate gets another 5 days to request a review for fairness, if they want to pursue. The requests go to the ministry’s Deputy Minister (DM).  

Candidates external to BC Gov can request feedback, but cannot request a review from the DM. 

This timeframe does not end on a weekend or statutory holiday.  

**Step 6** 

Onboarding to our organization begins after the review period ends.  

Competitions’ timelines can vary because of many factors:  

-  Statuary holidays  

-  How long a posting is open 

-  Complexity of technical assessments 

-  Number of candidates  

-  Interview scheduling  

-  Connecting with references  

-  Security clearance 

The quickest timeframe from posting to verbal offer we had was 6 weeks. We do our best to inform candidates when we pass or move onto key milestones. 

We encourage all candidates, whether they received the final offer or not, to ask for feedback.
