# Overview {% #Overview %}

The Cross-Ministry Hiring Program uses one job profile to fill many positions acros BC Government. The outcome of CMHP is an Eligibility List (e-List), as the program intends to have pre-qualified candidates on this list. Hiring managers get candidates from this list through a matching process. 

Our team gives administrative support. With dedicated Public Service Agency (PSA) resources, we have shorter wait times. For hiring managers, they get candidates quicker. For candidates, they do not need to apply to similar positions.

## Matching candidates and opportunities {% #matching-candidates-and-opportunities %}

The CMHP has a candidate focused matching process. Candidates give us their preferred locations and jobs. We match this with hiring managers' skillset preference. The matches happen in order of candidate ranking.  

{% div className="my-4 p-4" %}

{% div className="font-bold text-sm" %}
We collect:
{% /div %}

- candidate's {% span className="font-bold" %} work location {% /span %} preference
- candidate's {% span className="font-bold" %} job opportunity {% /span %} preference (the team they'd like to work on)
- hiring managers' {% span className="font-bold" %} skill set {% /span %} preferences
