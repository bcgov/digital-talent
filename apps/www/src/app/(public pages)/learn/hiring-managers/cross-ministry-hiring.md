# Overview {% #Overview %}

The Cross-Ministry Hiring Program uses one job profile to fill many positions acros BC Government. The outcome of the CMHP is an Eligibility List (e-List), because the program intends to have pre-qualified candidates on this list. Hiring managers get candidates from this list through a matching process. 

Our team gives administrative support. With dedicated Public Service Agency (PSA) resources, we have shorter wait times. For hiring managers, they get candidates quicker without spending hours of labour. For candidates, they do not need to apply to similar position, and they save time. Candidates' experience with BC Govt hiring becomes better.

## Matching candidates and job opportunities {% #matching-candidates-and-job-opportunities %}

The CMHP has a candidate focused matching process. Candidates rank their preferred locations and job opportunities. We match this with hiring managers' skillset preference. The matches happen in order of the candidate ranking. The decision of candidate ranking comes from candidate screening, assessement, intervews, reference checks and years of service.

{% div className="my-4 p-4" %}

{% div className="font-bold text-sm" %}
We collect:
{% /div %}

- candidate's {% span className="font-bold" %} work location {% /span %} preference
- candidate's {% span className="font-bold" %} job opportunity {% /span %} preference (the team they want to work on)
- hiring managers' {% span className="font-bold" %} skill set {% /span %} preferences
