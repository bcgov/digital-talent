# Overview {% #Overview %}

The Cross-Ministry Hiring Program uses one job profile to fill many positions across BC Government. The outcome of the CMHP is an [Eligibility List (E-list)](hiring-managers/hiring-options) of pre-qualified candidates. Hiring managers and candidates are matched based on candidate preferences.

Our team gives administrative support. With dedicated Public Service Agency (PSA) resources, we have shorter wait times. For hiring managers, they get candidates quicker without spending hours of labour. For candidates, they do not need to apply to similar position, and they save time. Candidates' experience with BC Govt hiring becomes better.

## Matching candidates and job opportunities {% #matching-candidates-and-job-opportunities %}

The CMHP matches candidates with job opportunities based on a candidate-focused process. We create an Eligibility list of successful candidates. Ranking decision comes from screening, assessment, interviews and Years of Continous Services (YOCS)

After, candidates rank their preferred working location(s) and job opportunities. We match this with hiring managers' skillset preferences. 

{% div className="my-4 p-4" %}

{% div className="font-bold text-sm" %}
Matching recipe:
{% /div %}

- candidate's {% span className="font-bold" %} work location(s) {% /span %} preference
- candidate's {% span className="font-bold" %} job opportunities {% /span %} preference (the team they want to work on)
- hiring managers' {% span className="font-bold" %} skillset {% /span %} preferences

{% /div %}
