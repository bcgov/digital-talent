On April 6th, 2023, the Digital Office released [BC Public Service's Digital Plan](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/digital-government/digital-plan.pdf). One of many items reported on are hiring barriers:

> Early on, the Exchange Lab recognized that ministries faced several barriers to building digital capacity. It often took months or years to bring in external vendors to support digital initiatives. Further, there was no clear path for existing employees to develop their own digital skills, and ministries struggled to attract and hire talented technologists from outside government.

DTC is a subject matter expert with cross-functional talent from the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) within the Ministry of Citizens Services (CITZ), and the Public Service Agency (PSA).

We work, live, and play on the unceded and ancestral lands of lək̓ʷəŋən People, now known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations, scəw̓aθən (Tsawwassen), xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) and Coast Salish Peoples, Kwikwetlem First Nation, hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and Sḵwx̱wú7mesh speaking Peoples, and Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc territory.

The diversity of these lands shapes our team members and impacts the foundation of our hiring and consulting services for agile teams. We are passionate about delivering improved and streamlined hiring services so the BC Public Service continues and scales employing brilliant workers. Our contribution to the resolution of the Province's complex problems is partnering with hiring managers across government to build their capacity for digital talent.
